== Introduction

This document contains the RISC-V platform-level interrupt controller (PLIC)
specification, which defines an interrupt controller specifically designed to
work in the context of RISC-V systems.  The PLIC multiplexes various device
interrupts onto the external interrupt lines of Hart contexts, with
hardware support for interrupt priorities. +
This specification defines the general PLIC architecture and operation parameters.
The PLIC which claimed as PLIC-Compliant standard PLIC should follow the
implementations mentioned in sections below.

Sections below describe the control register blocks of PLIC operation parameters.

== Register Width

The memory map register width is in 32-bit.

== Interrupt Priorities

If PLIC supports Interrupt Priorities, then each PLIC interrupt source can be assigned a priority by writing to its 32-bit
memory-mapped `priority` register.  A priority value of 0 is reserved to mean ''never interrupt'' and effectively 
disables the interrupt. Priority 1 is the lowest active priority while the maximum level of priority depends on 
PLIC implementation. Ties between global interrupts of the same priority are broken by the Interrupt ID; interrupts 
with the lowest ID have the highest
effective priority. +
 +
The base address of Interrupt Source Priority block within PLIC Memory Map region is fixed at 0x000000.

in this memory block. Interrupt Source Priority #0 is reserved which indicates it does not exist.

	...
	0x000FFC: Interrupt source 1023 priority

== Interrupt Pending Bits

The current status of the interrupt source pending bits in the PLIC core can be
read from the pending array, organized as 32-bit register.  The pending bit
for interrupt ID N is stored in bit (N mod 32) of word (N/32).  Bit 0
of word 0, which represents the non-existent interrupt source 0, is hardwired
to zero.

A pending bit in the PLIC core can be cleared by setting the associated enable
bit then performing a claim. +
 +
The base address of Interrupt Pending Bits block within PLIC Memory Map region is fixed at 0x001000.

	0x001000: Interrupt Source #0 to #31 Pending Bits

== Interrupt Enables

Each global interrupt can be enabled by setting the corresponding bit in the
`enables` register. The `enables` registers are accessed as a contiguous array
of 32-bit registers, packed the same way as the `pending` bits. Bit 0 of enable
register 0 represents the non-existent interrupt ID 0 and is hardwired to 0.
PLIC has 15872 Interrupt Enable blocks for the contexts. The `context` is referred 
to the specific privilege mode in the specific Hart of specific RISC-V processor 
instance. How PLIC organizes interrupts for the contexts (Hart and privilege mode) 
is out of RISC-V PLIC specification scope, however it must be spec-out in vendor's 
PLIC specification. +

== Priority Thresholds

PLIC provides context based `threshold register` for the settings of a interrupt priority 
threshold of each context. The `threshold register` is a WARL field. The PLIC will mask all 
PLIC interrupts of a priority less than or equal to `threshold`.  For example,
a`threshold` value of zero permits all interrupts with non-zero priority. +
 +
The base address of Priority Thresholds register block is located at 4K alignement starts 
from offset 0x200000.

	0x3FFF000: Priority threshold for context 15871
	
== Interrupt Claim Process

The PLIC can perform an interrupt claim by reading the `claim/complete`
register, which returns the ID of the highest priority pending interrupt or
zero if there is no pending interrupt.  A successful claim will also atomically
clear the corresponding pending bit on the interrupt source. +
The PLIC can perform a claim at any time and the claim operation is not affected
by the setting of the priority threshold register. +
The Interrupt Claim Process register is context based and is located at 
(4K alignement + 4) starts from offset 0x200000.

	0x3FFF004: Interrupt Claim Process for context 15871
	
## Interrupt Completion

The PLIC signals it has completed executing an interrupt handler by writing the
interrupt ID it received from the claim to the `claim/complete` register.  The
PLIC does not check whether the completion ID is the same as the last claim ID
for that target.  If the completion ID does not match an interrupt source that
is currently enabled for the target, the completion is silently ignored. +
The Interrupt Completion registers are context based and located at the same address 
with Interrupt Claim Process register, which is at (4K alignement + 4) starts from 
offset 0x200000.
