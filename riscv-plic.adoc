## Introduction

This document contains the RISC-V platform-level interrupt controller (PLIC)
specification, which defines an interrupt controller specifically designed to
work in the context of RISC-V systems.  The PLIC multiplexes various device
interrupts onto the external interrupt lines of various Hart contexts, with
hardware support for interrupt priorities. +
This specification defines the general PLIC architecture and operation parameters.
However, the PLICv1 spec-out here is the RISC-V Platform Level Interrupt
Controller which is commonly using on RISC-V platforms currently.

## The RISC-V PLICv1

RISC-V PLICv1 is the first version of RISC-V platform-level interrupt controller 
which simply defines the operation parameters for configuring the characteristics
of external interrupts and handling external interrupt events. Besides of the base
address of PLIC memory-mapped registers which is platform-specific implementation,
the control registers of PLIC are designed to locate at the fixed offset within
memory-mapped region. The characteristics of PLIC operation parameters are fixed as
well. The PLIC which claimed as PLICv1-Compliant should follow the implementations
mentioned in below sections.

Below sections describe the control register blocks of PLIC operation parameters.

## Register Width

The memory map register width is in 32-bit.

## Interrupt Priorities

If PLIC support Interrupt Priorities, then each PLIC interrupt source can be assigned a priority by writing to its `n-bit`
memory-mapped `priority` register.  The `n-bit` indicates the bits which takes from 32-bit length register for configuring Interrupt Source Priority level. The `n-bit` must be the value of power of 2 and less than 32-bit. A priority value of 0 is reserved to mean
''never interrupt'' and effectively disables the interrupt. Priority 1 is the
lowest active priority while the maximun level of priority depends on PLIC implementation. Ties between global interrupts of the same priority
are broken by the Interrupt ID; interrupts with the lowest ID have the highest
effective priority. +

|This is a continuously memory block which contains PLIC Interrupt Source Priority. Total N Interrupt Source Priority in this memory block. Interrupt Source Priority #0 is reserved which indicates it does not exist. + 
The length of effective bits of each Interrupt Source Priority is PLIC design-specific. The total bits which taken from 32-bit length register for each Interrupt Source Priority maybe larger than the effective bits used by interrupt priority level. + 
`Width of Register` (32-bit) may equal to the bits occupied by Interrupt Source Priority(`n-bit`) or larger than (`n-bit`)

	0x000FFC: Interrupt source 1023 priority

## Interrupt Pending Bits

The current status of the interrupt source pending bits in the PLIC core can be
read from the pending array, organized as 32-bit register.  The pending bit
for interrupt ID N is stored in bit (N mod 32) of word (N/32).  Bit 0
of word 0, which represents the non-existent interrupt source 0, is hardwired
to zero.

A pending bit in the PLIC core can be cleared by setting the associated enable
bit then performing a claim. +

## Interrupt Enables

Each global interrupt can be enabled by setting the corresponding bit in the
`enables` register. The `enables` registers are accessed as a contiguous array
of 32-bit registers, packed the same way as the `pending` bits. Bit 0 of enable
register 0 represents the non-existent interrupt ID 0 and is hardwired to 0.
PLIC may have multiple Interrupt Enable Bits blocks for the contexts according to
PLIC implementation. The `context` is referred to the specific privilege mode in the
specific Hart of the specific RISC-V processor instance. How PLIC organizes interrupts
for the contexts (Hart and privilege mode) is out of RISC-V PLIC specification scope, 
however it must be spec-out in vendor's PLIC specification.

## Priority Thresholds

If PLIC supports Interrupt Priorities, the PLIC could optionally provide `threshold register`
for the settings of a interrupt priority threshold. The `threshold register` is a WARL field.
The PLIC will mask all PLIC interrupts of a priority less than or equal to `threshold`.  For example,
a`threshold` value of zero permits all interrupts with non-zero priority. +
Priority Thresholds registers are not necessary be organized in continuously. That is PLIC
implementation-specific and out of RISC-V PLIC specification scope, however it must be spec-out
in vendor's PLIC specification. +
 +
*For PLICv1-specific*, Priority Threshold registers are not organized in continuously in memory-mapped region.
Priority Threshold for each context is located at 4K alignement starts from offset 0x200000 as
it delineated in memory map below.

	...
	...
	...
	0x3FFF000: Priority threshold for context 15871
	
## Interrupt Claim Process

The PLIC can perform an interrupt claim by reading the `claim/complete`
register, which returns the ID of the highest priority pending interrupt or
zero if there is no pending interrupt.  A successful claim will also atomically
clear the corresponding pending bit on the interrupt source. +
The PLIC can perform a claim at any time and the claim operation is not affected
by the setting of the priority threshold register. +
The Interrupt Claim Process register are context based and not necessary be organized in continuously.
That is PLIC implementation-specific and out of RISC-V PLIC specification scope, however
it must be spec-out in vendor's PLIC specification. +
 +
*For PLICv1-specific*, Interrupt Claim Process registers are not organized in continuously in memory-mapped region.
Interrupt Claim Process register for each ceach context is located at (4K alignement + 4) starts from offset 0x200000 as
it delineated in memory map below.

	...
	...
	...
	0x3FFF004: Interrupt Claim Process for context 15871
	
## Interrupt Completion

The PLIC signals it has completed executing an interrupt handler by writing the
interrupt ID it received from the claim to the `claim/complete` register.  The
PLIC does not check whether the completion ID is the same as the last claim ID
for that target.  If the completion ID does not match an interrupt source that
is currently enabled for the target, the completion is silently ignored. +
The Interrupt Completion registers are context based and not necessary be organized in continuously.
That is PLIC implementation-specific and out of RISC-V PLIC specification scope,
however it must be spec-out in vendor's PLIC specification. +
The Interrupt Completion register is the same address as PLIC Interrupt Claim Process hence the read access is for PLIC Interrupt Claim Process,
the write access is for Interrupt Completion. +
 +
*For PLICv1-specific*, Interrupt Completion registers are not organized in continuously in memory-mapped region.
Interrupt Completion register for each context is located at (4K alignement + 4) starts from offset 0x200000 as
it delineated in memory map below.

### 5.2.12.19 RISC-V Platform Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC) Structure
PLIC is used as platform global external interrupt controller for RISC-V processor. PLIC can be connected to RISC-V processor and the Harts in the processor according to the platform design. Multiple PLIC structures is possible reported in MDAT for multiple RISC-V physical processor on platform. The Privilege Modes of external interrupt is also configurable. The properties of interrupt event source and settings of PLIC should be configured by system firmware during POST according to the platform design. The settings of PLIC must be reported in MADT PLIC structure by system firmware. ACPI compliant OS can install the corresponding interrupt handler for handling Supervisor Mode external interrupts. In the case if external interrupt is triggered as Machine Mode external interrupt and the Machine Mode external interrupt is not delegated to Supervisor Mode according to ACPI SDEI table, OS will have to register event handler on Machine Mode external interrupt using Supervisor Binary Interface.

### For the platforms the OS image with device driver which well knows the configuration of RISC-V PLICv1:

In this use case, the Device Tree of RISC-V PLICv1 could be small and simple.
