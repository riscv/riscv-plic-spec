== Introduction

This specification delineates the operation parameters according the general PLIC
architecture defined in the RISC-V platform-level interrupt controller (PLIC)
specification (was removed from https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/draft-20181201-5449851/riscv-privileged.pdf[RISC-V Privileged Spec v1.11-draft]) to work in the context of RISC-V systems.  +
The PLIC multiplexes various device interrupts onto the external interrupt lines
of Hart contexts, with hardware support for interrupt priorities. PLIC supports
up-to 1023 interrupts (0 is reserved) and 15872 contexts, but the actual number of
interrupts and context depends on the PLIC implementation. However, the implement
must adhere to the  offset of each register within the PLIC operation parameters.
The PLIC which claimed as PLIC-Compliant standard PLIC should follow the 
implementations mentioned in sections below.

=== Interrupt Targets and Hart Contexts

Interrupt targets are usually hart contexts, where a hart context is a given
privilege mode on a given hart (though there are other possible interrupt targets,
such as DMA engines). For example, in an 4-core system with 2-way SMT, you have 8
harts and probably at least two privilege modes per hart: machine mode and
supervisor mode (link:https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/5bfc75d92efd494db37f5c4c173d3639d4772966/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/sifive%2Cplic-1.0.0.yaml[Ref]). +
Not all hart contexts need be interrupt targets, in
particular, if a processor core does not support delegating external interrupts to
lower-privilege modes, then the lower-privilege hart contexts will not be interrupt
targets. Interrupt notiﬁcations generated by the PLIC appear in the meip/heip/seip/
ueip bits of the mip/hip/sip/uip registers for M/H/S/U modes respectively. The
notiﬁcations only appear in lower-privilege xip registers if external interrupts
have been delegated to the lower-privilege modes. +
Each processor core must deﬁne a
policy on how simultaneous active interrupts are taken by multiple hart contexts
on the core. For the simple case of a single stack of hart contexts, one for each
supported privileged mode, interrupts for higher-privilege contexts can preempt
execution of interrupt handlers for lower-privilege contexts. A multithreaded
processor core could run multiple independent interrupt handlers on diﬀerent hart
contexts at the same time. A processor core could also provide hart contexts that
are only used for interrupt handling to reduce interrupt service latency, and
these might preempt interrupt handlers for other harts on the same core. +
The PLIC treats each interrupt target independently and does not take into account
any interrupt prioritization scheme used by a component that contains multiple
interrupt targets. As a result, the PLIC provides no concept of interrupt
preemption or nesting so this must be handled by the cores hosting multiple
interrupt target contexts.

=== Interrupt Gateways

The interrupt gateways are responsible for converting global interrupt signals 
into a common interrupt request format, and for controlling the ﬂow of interrupt
requests to the PLIC core. At most one interrupt request per interrupt source can
be pending in the PLIC core at any time, indicated by setting the source's IP bit.
The gateway only forwards a new interrupt request to the PLIC core after receiving 
notiﬁcation that the interrupt handler servicing the previous interrupt request
from the same source has completed. +
If the global interrupt source uses level-sensitive interrupts, the gateway will 
convert the ﬁrst assertion of the interrupt level into an interrupt request, but
thereafter the gateway will not forward an additional interrupt request until it
receives an interrupt completion message. On receiving an interrupt completion
message, if the interrupt is level-triggered and the interrupt is still asserted, a
new interrupt request will be forwarded to the PLIC core. The gateway does not
have the facility to retract an interrupt request once forwarded to the PLIC core. 
If a level-sensitive interrupt source deasserts the interrupt after the PLIC core
accepts the request and before the interrupt is serviced, the interrupt request
remains present in the IP bit of the PLIC core and will be serviced by a handler,
which will then have to determine that the interrupt device no longer requires
service. +
If the global interrupt source was edge-triggered, the gateway will convert the
ﬁrst matching signal edge into an interrupt request. Depending on the design of 
the device and the interrupt handler, in between sending an interrupt request and 
receiving notice of its handler's completion, the gateway might either ignore
additional matching edges or increment a counter of pending interrupts. In either
case, the next interrupt request will not be forwarded to the PLIC core until the
previous completion message has been received. If the gateway has a pending
interrupt counter, the counter will be decremented when the interrupt request is
accepted by the PLIC core. Unlike dedicated-wire interrupt signals,
message-signalled interrupts (MSIs) are sent over the system interconnect via a
message packet that describes which interrupt is being asserted. The message
is decoded to select an interrupt gateway, and the relevant gateway then handles
the MSI similar to an edge-triggered interrupt.

=== Interrupt Notiﬁcations

Each interrupt target has an external interrupt pending (EIP) bit in the PLIC core
that indicates that the corresponding target has a pending interrupt waiting for
service. The value in EIP can change as a result of changes to state in the PLIC
core, brought on by interrupt sources, interrupt targets, or other agents
manipulating register values in the PLIC. The value in EIP is communicated
to the destination target as an interrupt notiﬁcation. If the target is a RISC-V
hart context, the interrupt notiﬁcations arrive on the meip/heip/seip/ueip bits 
depending on the privilege level of the hart context. +
(_In simple systems, the
interrupt notiﬁcations will be simple wires connected to the processor
implementing a hart. In more complex platforms, the notiﬁcations might be routed
as messages across a system interconnect._) +

The PLIC hardware only supports multicasting of interrupts, such that all enabled
targets will receive interrupt notiﬁcations for a given active interrupt. +
(_Multicasting provides rapid response since the fastest responder claims the
interrupt, but can be wasteful in high-interrupt-rate scenarios if multiple harts
take a trap for an interrupt that only one can successfully claim. Software can
modulate the PLIC IE bits as part of each interrupt handler to provide alternate
policies, such as interrupt aﬃnity or round-robin unicasting._) +

Depending on the platform architecture and the method used to transport interrupt
notiﬁcations, these might take some time to be received at the targets. The PLIC
is guaranteed to eventually deliver all state changes in EIP to all targets,
provided there is no intervening activity in the PLIC core. +
(_The value in an interrupt notiﬁcation is only guaranteed to hold an EIP value
that was valid at some point in the past. In particular, a second target can
respond and claim an interrupt while a notiﬁcation to the ﬁrst target is still in
ﬂight, such that when the ﬁrst target tries to claim the interrupt it ﬁnds it has
no active interrupts in the PLIC core._)

=== Interrupt Identiﬁers (IDs)

Global interrupt sources are assigned small unsigned integer identiﬁers, beginning
at the value 1. An interrupt ID of 0 is reserved to mean “no interrupt”. +
Interrupt identiﬁers are also used to break ties when two or more interrupt
sources have the same assigned priority. Smaller values of interrupt ID take precedence over larger values of interrupt ID.

=== Interrupt Flow

Below figure shows the messages ﬂowing between agents when handling interrupts
via the PLIC.

Sections below describe the control register blocks of PLIC operation parameters.

== Register Width

The memory map register width is in 32-bit.

== Interrupt Priorities

Interrupt priorities are small unsigned integers, with a platform-speciﬁc maximum
number of supported levels. The priority value 0 is reserved to mean "never
interrupt", and interrupt priority increases with increasing integer values.
Each global interrupt source has an associated interrupt priority held in a
memory-mapped register. Diﬀerent interrupt sources need not support the same set
of priority values. A valid implementation can hardwire all input priority levels.
Interrupt source priority registers should be WARL ﬁelds to allow software to
determine the number and position of read-write bits in each priority
speciﬁcation, if any. To simplify discovery of supported priority values, each
priority register must support any combination of values in the bits that are
variable within the register, i.e., if there are two variable bits in the
register, all four combinations of values in those bits must operate as valid priority levels.

If PLIC supports Interrupt Priorities, then each PLIC interrupt source can be
assigned a priority by writing to its 32-bit memory-mapped `priority` register.  A
priority value of 0 is reserved to mean "never interrupt" and effectively disables
the interrupt. Priority 1 is the lowest active priority while the maximum level of priority depends on PLIC implementation. Ties between global interrupts of the
same priority are broken by the Interrupt ID; interrupts with the lowest ID have
the highest effective priority. +
 +
The base address of Interrupt Source Priority block within PLIC Memory Map region is fixed at 0x000000.

== Interrupt Pending Bits

The current status of the interrupt source pending bits in the PLIC core can be
read from the pending array, organized as 32-bit register.  The pending bit
for interrupt ID N is stored in bit (N mod 32) of word (N/32).  Bit 0
of word 0, which represents the non-existent interrupt source 0, is hardwired
to zero.

A pending bit in the PLIC core can be cleared by setting the associated enable
bit then performing a claim. +

== Interrupt Enables

Each global interrupt can be enabled by setting the corresponding bit in the
`enables` register. The `enables` registers are accessed as a contiguous array
of 32-bit registers, packed the same way as the `pending` bits. Bit 0 of enable
register 0 represents the non-existent interrupt ID 0 and is hardwired to 0.
PLIC has 15872 Interrupt Enable blocks for the contexts. +
How PLIC organizes interrupts for the contexts (Hart and privilege mode) 
is out of RISC-V PLIC specification scope, however it must be spec-out in vendor's 
PLIC specification. +
(_A large number of potential IE bits might be hardwired to zero in cases where
some interrupt sources can only be routed to a subset of targets. A larger number
of bits might be wired to 1 for an embedded device with ﬁxed interrupt routing.
Interrupt priorities, thresholds, and hart-internal interrupt masking provide
considerable ﬂexibility in ignoring external interrupts even if a global interrupt
source is always enabled._) +

== Priority Thresholds

PLIC provides context based `threshold register` for the settings of a interrupt priority 
threshold of each context. The `threshold register` is a WARL field. The PLIC will mask all 
PLIC interrupts of a priority less than or equal to `threshold`.  For example,
a`threshold` value of zero permits all interrupts with non-zero priority. +
 +
The base address of Priority Thresholds register block is located at 4K alignment starts
from offset 0x200000.

== Interrupt Claim Process

Sometime after a target receives an interrupt notiﬁcation, it might decide to
service the interrupt. The target sends an interrupt claim message to the PLIC
core, which will usually be implemented as a non-idempotent memory-mapped I/O
control register read. On receiving a claim message, the PLIC core will atomically
determine the ID of the highest-priority pending interrupt for the target
and then clear down the corresponding source’s IP bit. The PLIC core will then
return the ID to the target. The PLIC core will return an ID of zero, if there
were no pending interrupts for the target when the claim was serviced. +
After the highest-priority pending interrupt is claimed by a target and the
corresponding IP bit is cleared, other lower-priority pending interrupts might
then become visible to the target, and so the PLIC EIP bit might not be cleared
after a claim. The interrupt handler can check the local meip/heip/seip/ueip bits
before exiting the handler, to allow more eﬃcient service of other interrupts
without ﬁrst restoring the interrupted context and taking another interrupt trap. +
It is always legal for a hart to perform a claim even if the EIP is not set. In
particular, a hart could set the threshold value to maximum to disable interrupt
notiﬁcations and instead poll for active interrupts using periodic claim requests,
though a simpler approach to implement polling would be to clear the external
interrupt enable in the corresponding xie register for privilege mode x. +

The PLIC can perform an interrupt claim by reading the `claim/complete`
register, which returns the ID of the highest priority pending interrupt or
zero if there is no pending interrupt.  A successful claim will also atomically
clear the corresponding pending bit on the interrupt source. The PLIC can perform a claim at any time and the claim operation is not affected
by the setting of the priority threshold register. +
 +
The Interrupt Claim Process register is context based and is located at 
(4K alignment + 4) starts from offset 0x200000.

## Interrupt Completion

The PLIC signals it has completed executing an interrupt handler by writing the
interrupt ID it received from the claim to the `claim/complete` register.  The
PLIC does not check whether the completion ID is the same as the last claim ID
for that target.  If the completion ID does not match an interrupt source that
is currently enabled for the target, the completion is silently ignored. +
After a handler has completed service of an interrupt, the associated gateway
must be sent an interrupt completion message, usually as a write to a
non-idempotent memory-mapped I/O control register. The gateway will only forward
additional interrupts to the PLIC core after receiving the completion message. +
 +
The Interrupt Completion registers are context based and located at the same address 
with Interrupt Claim Process register, which is at (4K alignment + 4) starts from
offset 0x200000.
